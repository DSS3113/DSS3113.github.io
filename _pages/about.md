ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Danish, a junior studying Computer Science at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's</a> <a href="https://grainger.illinois.edu/">Grainger College of Engineering</a>. I am from India an extremely diverse country with a plethora of cultures which has given me a unique perspective that I bring to my work in tech.

I'm passionate about developing innovations that can make a real difference in the world. While I'm still exploring my career options, I'm currently most drawn to roles as a machine learning engineer or software developer where I can tackle complex problems and contribute meaningfully to society.

When I'm not coding or studying, I maintain balance in my life through various activities. You'll often find me consuming horror movies or series; watching anime; reading about language, culture, and religion; or immersing myself in poetryâ€”a creative outlet that complements my technical interests.

I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and eager to use my skills to create technology that betters our world!
